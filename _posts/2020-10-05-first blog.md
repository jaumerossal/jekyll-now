Lets start this off introducing all the things i'm working on at the time of starting to write. 

 _I wonder what this looks like_
 
> I wonder what this looks like


### Affiliate 1

My main project at the time is building a large traffic driven site that we will at some point turn into some sort of affiliate project. This project will remain unnamed. 

## [UsedTeslaWorld](https://usedteslaworld.co.uk/)

This project is a side-side project that I built exclusively using no-code tools on webflow and zapier. 

## Learning to code 

Slowly starting to make my way into web dev, and am starting a web dev bootcamp for lewagon in a few weeks! 

## Jaume.io 

I am following Pat Walls and Jordan O'connor in their quest to blog not only for themselves but to build in public. 

The goal for this site is not too clear yet but i'd like to blog not only to have written documentation of my process and journey of building things but also hopefully to garner an audience for future things I build! 


Lets gO0o0o0o0o0o0o0o!!!!!!!
