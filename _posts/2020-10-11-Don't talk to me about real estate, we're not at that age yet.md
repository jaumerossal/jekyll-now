It isn't often that I feel out of place - I like to be as adaptive as possible and always try to understand where people are coming from. 

<h2> "Don't talk to me about real estate, we're not at that age yet" </h2> 

This was said to me by a close friend of mine not too long ago. I realize that me wanting to talk about real estate has been a thing since I was in highschool.
My brothers and I have been obssessed with the idea of making passive income, and real estate was always at the top of the list. 

Perhaps it's silly to think that everyone wants to hear about real estate/ how to make money online / how to not go into a random corporate job
and I think that's fine, I just forget what is normal and what isn't. 

Being surrounded by my brothers creates a microcosm of constantly chasing what's next, and that for us is never a "normal job". I definitely don't think there's anything 
wrong with getting a normal job, and I think I am extremely lucky in the fact that i'm even able to consider ideas other than getting a normal job. 

However I'd say that one of the things that pushes my brothers and I most to work towards the direction of building our own things has to do with how much we saw our dad work throughout our life. 

He was an executive for a pharmaceutical company, would easily work 50 hour weeks, and would almost never be home. It is a sacrifice that we won't ever be able to pay him back for, 
yet, I feel that we owe it to him, to come up with a different way of working and push the boundaries on what is expected of us. 

For whatever reason, I seem to have been interested in real estate starting at 16, and I think that's fucking sick. 
For a close friend of mine to say that to me, all it says is that i'm hanging with the wrong crowd.
